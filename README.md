# Lighthouse Labs | Multimedia in Ruby with Gosu

## Getting Started with Gosu

> **Gosu (고수)**: person at an expert skill level; someone who has achieved mastery of a skill. [*Korean in origin*.]

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), originally developed in 1995 by Matz of Japan, is a popular programmer-friendly interpreted scripting language.

Yes, that was a mouthful! If you haven't had the chance to give it a try, you may have heard of it—or its well-known web development framework: [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

While Ruby spiked in popularity with the introduction of its incredibly powerful and industry-changing Ruby on Rails solution in 2005, it is capable of a lot more than just web development.

You'll find, if you daily drive Linux or Macintosh, that many installation tools and command-line software uses Ruby for part, or all, of their processes. Okay, so it is great for desktop scripting and automation—what else?

I'm glad you asked! If Ruby stretches first, it is capable of running all sorts of marathons, some of which you may not expect! Today's focus? A [Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/) (library / package) called [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/ruby.html), that opens the doors to creating interactive multimedia software for your desktop computer.

What do I mean by interactive multimedia software? I mean programs capable of displaying graphics, playing sound, and accepting user input! Sound like a certain type of computer program you may have spent some time with before? This is the perfect recipe for GUI software or even video game development.

Today, let's keep it fun and focus on the latter, as that's Gosu's bread and butter.
